This project leverages deep learning to create a cutting-edge AI-powered nutrition analyzer tailored for fitness enthusiasts. By analyzing food images or input data, the system identifies ingredients, estimates nutritional values (calories, protein, carbs, fats), and provides personalized diet recommendations aligned with fitness goals like weight loss, muscle gain, or maintenance. The solution employs computer vision models for food recognition and integrates user profiles to deliver accurate and actionable insights, promoting healthier and goal-oriented eating habits.
